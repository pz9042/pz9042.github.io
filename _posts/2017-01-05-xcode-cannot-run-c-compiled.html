<h3 id="configure-error-cannot-run-c-compiled-programs">configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs</h3>

<p>S command: <br>
haring about solving the issue after upgrading to Mac OS X El Capitan.</p>

<p>Error <br>
I have homebrew setup before. <br>
After upgrading to latest Mac OS X, I ran the following command in order to solve another ssl related issue:</p>

<p>brew install openssl <br>
It returned the following error:</p>

<p>checking whether we are cross compiling… configure: error: in `/private/tmp/pkg-config20150611-7353-5bg3wh/pkg-config-0.28′: <br>
configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs. <br>
Full error here:</p>

<p>Solution <br>
From the error log, it seemed related to compiling library code. I tried cleanup and setup everything and found out that it was the Xcode command line tools. To install/reinstall that, run the following <br>
xcode-select –install</p></div></body></html>
